The dataset is comprised of several smaller datasets: *Appendix C - lexical frequency list (see: Smith, R. G. & Hofmann, M., (2020). A Lexical Frequency Analysis of Irish Sign Language. TEANGA, the Journal of the Irish Association for Applied Linguistics, 11, 18â€“47. https://doi.org/10.35903/teanga.v11i1.162)

*Appendix D - Association rules. This was the main output of the PhD work. See the dissertation for method. (this dir includes filtered and unfiltered data)

*Appendix E - Datasets used to generate association rules *Appendix F - Source code (R) used to generate rules listed in Appendix D *Appendix G - Source code (R) used for integrity testing
